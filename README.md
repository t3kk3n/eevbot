# eevbot

[update]
This is legacy code for the old bot, it is now running thanks to the Sopel project, see here - https://sopel.chat/
[/update]

This is the source code to the AustNet EEVBlog IRC channel bot. It originally started as a minor side project, then turned into a bigger project over time, and ultimately took over the (EEVBlog) IRC world.

The main feature of this bot, is to cross post the twitter posts from the official EEVBlog twitter page, along with a few other goodies. Feel free to use this code, poke at it, prod it, etc, but if you decide to use any code from here, just give me a mention in your source code, that's all I ask. My nick in the AustNet EEVBlog channel is electrohead, feel free to ask questions if need be.

To note - I modified the IRC library (irclib.py) a tiny bit to work with identification on the AustNet network, so if [you] try to make it connect to a different network, problems may arise; I haven't tried connecting this to any other networks, so feedback is welcome, etc. Eventually, this library will either be completely rewritten, or simply replaced.

Cheers!
